# SBA-308-JavaScriptF


This is my read me file for SBA-308 Java fundamentals. 
I analyze and transform this data such that the output of my program is an array of objects, each containing the following information in the following format:
{
    // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected
    "id": number,
    // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
    // with more points_possible should be counted for more
    // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
    // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
    "avg": number,
    // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
    // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
    // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
    <assignment_id>: number,
    // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
    // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
}

If an AssignmentGroup does not belong to its course (mismatching course_id), my  program throws an error, letting the user know that the input was invalid. Similar data validation should occur elsewhere within the program.

Im still figuring out how to make sure my function output corretly
